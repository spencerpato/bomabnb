# Referral System Fix - Documentation

## Overview
Fixed the referral tracking system to properly display agent referral information in both the admin dashboard (for partners) and agent dashboard (for their referrals).

## Problem Statement
When an agent shared a referral link and a partner registered using that link, the referral relationship was not visible in:
1. **Admin Partners Dashboard** - Couldn't see which agent referred each partner
2. **Agent Referrals Page** - Referrals were not displaying properly with agent-specific layout

## Changes Made

### 1. Admin Partners Page (`src/pages/AdminPartners.tsx`)

#### Added Referrer Information to Partner Interface
```typescript
interface Partner {
  // ... existing fields
  referrer_info?: {
    referrer_id: string;
    business_name: string | null;
    referral_code: string;
    profiles: {
      full_name: string;
    };
  } | null;
}
```

#### Enhanced Data Fetching
- Added query to fetch referral information from `referrals` table
- Joins with `referrers` table to get agent details
- Retrieves agent profile information (full name, business name, referral code)

#### UI Updates
- **Partners Table**: Added "Referred By" column showing:
  - Agent's full name
  - Agent's referral code
  - "Direct" label for partners not referred by an agent

- **Mobile Card View**: Added referrer information in partner cards

- **Partner Profile Dialog**: Added dedicated referral information section showing:
  - ü§ù Referral Information heading
  - Referred By (Agent) - Full name and business name
  - Agent Referral Code - Displayed in monospace font

### 2. Agent Referrals Page (`src/pages/AgentReferrals.tsx`)

#### Created New Component
- Built dedicated `AgentReferrals` component using `AgentLayout` for consistency
- Improved from the generic `ReferrerReferrals` component

#### Enhanced Features
- **Better Profile Display**: Shows partner's full name and email
- **Improved Stats Cards**: 
  - Properties Listed count
  - Bookings count
  - Total commissions earned
- **Enhanced Empty State**: Shows helpful message with icon when no referrals exist
- **Better Status Badges**: Clear visual indicators for partner status (Active, Pending, Suspended, Rejected)
- **Detailed Timestamps**: Shows both referral date and registration date

### 3. Routing Update (`src/App.tsx`)

#### Route Changes
- Imported `AgentReferrals` component
- Updated `/agent-referrals` route to use `AgentReferrals` instead of `ReferrerReferrals`
- Maintains separate routes for referrer (`/referrer-referrals`) and agent (`/agent-referrals`) interfaces

## Database Schema (No Changes Required)

The existing schema already supports this functionality:

### `referrals` Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.referrals (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  referrer_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES public.referrers(id),
  partner_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES public.partners(id) UNIQUE,
  referred_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active',
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### `referrers` Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.referrers (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  referral_code TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  business_name TEXT,
  contact_phone TEXT,
  contact_email TEXT,
  status partner_status NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
  commission_rate DECIMAL(5,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 10.00,
  -- ... other fields
);
```

## How It Works

### Registration Flow with Referral
1. Agent shares referral link: `https://your-domain.com/register?ref=ABC12345`
2. Partner clicks link and registers
3. During registration (`PartnerRegister.tsx`):
   - Referral code is extracted from URL parameter
   - System verifies referral code exists and is active
   - Partner record is created
   - **Referral record is created** linking partner to agent
4. Referral is now visible in both:
   - Admin Partners dashboard (showing which agent referred the partner)
   - Agent Referrals dashboard (showing their referred partners)

### Data Flow
```

Referral Record Created (partner_id + referrer_id)
    ‚Üì
