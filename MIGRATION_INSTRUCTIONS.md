# Rating & Review System - Database Migration Instructions

## Overview
A comprehensive rating and review system has been added to BomaBnB. To enable this feature, you need to apply the database migration to your Supabase database.

### Option 2: Using Supabase CLI
If you have the Supabase CLI installed:
```bash
supabase db push
```

## What the Migration Creates
