# ✅ Featured Property Rotation System - COMPLETE

## 🎯 Objective Achieved
All featured properties now get **equal exposure** through a fair rotation system. No property stays at the top permanently - they rotate periodically based on when they were last displayed.

---

## 🗄️ Step 1: Database Setup

### **SQL to Run in Supabase**

```sql
-- Add the rotation tracking column
ALTER TABLE properties 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_featured_display TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NULL;

-- Create an index for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_properties_last_featured_display 
ON properties(last_featured_display NULLS FIRST) 
WHERE is_featured = TRUE;

-- Verify the column was added
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'properties' 
AND column_name = 'last_featured_display';
```

**What this does**:
- `last_featured_display`: Tracks when each featured property was last shown at the top
- `NULL` values = Never displayed yet (these get priority)
- Index ensures fast queries even with many properties

---

## 🔄 Step 2: Rotation Logic (IMPLEMENTED)

### **How It Works**

#### Fetch Logic (`src/pages/Index.tsx` lines 47-87)
```typescript
// 1. Fetch featured properties with rotation
const { data: featuredData } = await supabase
  .from("properties")
  .select("*")
  .eq("is_active", true)
  .eq("is_featured", true)
  .order("last_featured_display", { ascending: true, nullsFirst: true })
  .limit(5);

// 2. Update timestamps after display
const featuredIds = featuredData.map(p => p.id);
await supabase
  .from("properties")
  .update({ last_featured_display: new Date().toISOString() })
  .in("id", featuredIds);
```

**Rotation Algorithm**:
1. **Query**: Select properties where `is_featured = true`
2. **Order by**: `last_featured_display` (oldest first, NULL first)
3. **Limit**: Top 5 properties
4. **Update**: Set their `last_featured_display` to NOW

**Result**: Next page load will show 5 different featured properties!

---

## 🎠 Step 3: Auto-Rotating Carousel (IMPLEMENTED)

### **FeaturedCarousel Component**
**File**: `src/components/FeaturedCarousel.tsx`

**Features**:
- ✅ Auto-rotates every 8 seconds
- ✅ Smooth scroll transitions
- ✅ Pauses on hover (better UX)
- ✅ Manual navigation arrows (desktop only)
- ✅ Dot indicators showing current position
- ✅ "Auto-rotating" badge when active

**Code Highlights**:
```typescript
// Auto-rotation effect
useEffect(() => {
  if (isPaused || children.length <= 1) return;

  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    setCurrentIndex((prev) => (prev + 1) % children.length);
  }, 8000); // 8 seconds

  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, [children.length, isPaused]);
```

**User Experience**:
- Hover over carousel → Pauses automatically
- Click arrows → Pauses for 3 seconds then resumes
- Click dots → Jump to specific property, pause for 3 seconds
- Mobile → Touch swipe works naturally

## 📊 Rotation Flow Diagram

```
Homepage Load
    ↓
Query: Get top 5 featured properties
       ORDER BY last_featured_display ASC NULLS FIRST
    ↓
Properties Retrieved:
  - Property A (last_displayed: NULL) ← Never shown, gets priority
  - Property B (last_displayed: 2 days ago)
  - Property C (last_displayed: 1 day ago)
  - Property D (last_displayed: 12 hours ago)
  - Property E (last_displayed: 6 hours ago)
    ↓
Display these 5 in auto-rotating carousel
    ↓
Update: SET last_featured_display = NOW() for all 5
    ↓
Next homepage load will show 5 DIFFERENT properties
```

## 🎯 Fair Exposure Example

### **Scenario: 15 Featured Properties**

**Load 1** (User visits homepage):
- Shows: Properties 1-5 (oldest timestamps)
- Updates: Their timestamps to NOW
- Result: They go to the back of the queue

**Load 2** (Different user visits):
- Shows: Properties 6-10 (now the oldest)
- Updates: Their timestamps to NOW
- Result: Properties 1-5 won't show again until everyone else has had a turn

**Load 3**:
- Shows: Properties 11-15
- Updates: Their timestamps

**Load 4**:
- Shows: Properties 1-5 again (they're now the oldest)
- **Fair rotation complete!** Everyone got equal exposure

## 🔧 Files Modified

### 1. **src/pages/Index.tsx**
**Lines 47-87**: Featured rotation logic
```typescript
// Fetches top 5 least-recently-displayed featured properties
// Updates their timestamps after display
```

**Lines 340-371**: Auto-rotating carousel integration
```typescript
<FeaturedCarousel autoRotateInterval={8000}>
  {featuredProperties.map((property) => (...))}
</FeaturedCarousel>
```

**Lines 14-28**: Added `last_featured_display` to Property interface

### 2. **src/components/FeaturedCarousel.tsx** (NEW)
Complete auto-rotating carousel with:
- 8-second auto-rotation
- Hover-to-pause
- Manual navigation
- Dot indicators
- Smooth animations

---

## 🎨 Visual Features

### **Auto-Rotation Indicator**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Featured Properties 🌟  [Auto-rotating] │
│                                     │

## 📈 Benefits for Partners

### Before (No Rotation):
- First 5 featured properties monopolize visibility
- Later featured properties rarely seen
- Unfair advantage to early adopters

### After (With Rotation):
✅ Every featured property gets equal time at the top
✅ Fair distribution across all partners
✅ Encourages more partners to feature their properties
✅ Better value for featured listing fees

---

## 🧪 Testing the Rotation

### **Step 1: Add Test Data**
```sql
-- Mark 10 properties as featured for testing
UPDATE properties 
SET is_featured = TRUE 
WHERE id IN (
  SELECT id FROM properties 
  WHERE is_active = TRUE 
  LIMIT 10
);

-- Reset timestamps to test fresh rotation
UPDATE properties 
SET last_featured_display = NULL 
WHERE is_featured = TRUE;
```

### **Step 2: Test Rotation**
1. **Load homepage** → Note which 5 properties show
2. **Refresh page** → Should see 5 DIFFERENT properties
3. **Refresh again** → Should see the remaining properties
4. **Check console logs**:
   ```
   Featured properties rotation: [
     { name: "Property 1", last_displayed: null },
     { name: "Property 2", last_displayed: "2025-..." }
   ]
   Updated featured display timestamps for fair rotation
   ```

### **Step 3: Test Auto-Carousel**
1. Don't touch the page → Should auto-scroll every 8 seconds
2. Hover over carousel → Should pause
3. Move mouse away → Should resume
4. Click arrows → Should navigate and pause
5. On mobile → Swipe should work

## 📊 Monitoring Rotation

### **Check Rotation Status**
```sql
-- See which properties are due to be shown next
SELECT 
  id,
  property_name,
  is_featured,
  last_featured_display,
  CASE 
    WHEN last_featured_display IS NULL THEN 'Never shown (Priority)'
    ELSE CONCAT('Last shown ', EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - last_featured_display))/3600, ' hours ago')
  END as display_status
FROM properties
WHERE is_featured = TRUE
ORDER BY last_featured_display ASC NULLS FIRST
LIMIT 10;
```

### **Check Fair Distribution**
```sql
-- Count how many times each featured property has been displayed
SELECT 
  property_name,
  CASE 
    WHEN last_featured_display IS NULL THEN 0
    ELSE 1
  END as display_count,
  last_featured_display
FROM properties
WHERE is_featured = TRUE
ORDER BY last_featured_display ASC NULLS FIRST;
```

**File**: `src/pages/Index.tsx` line 54
```typescript
.limit(5);  // Change to 3, 7, 10, etc.
```

### **Disable Auto-Rotation** (Keep Manual Controls)
**File**: `src/components/FeaturedCarousel.tsx` line 12
```typescript
autoRotateInterval = 0  // Set to 0 to disable
```
