## Admin Dashboard Updates Needed

I'll create a complete Admin Agent Management page with payment functionality. Here's what needs to be added:

### **New Page**: `AdminAgentPayments.tsx`
This will show:
1. Agent commission overview
2. Payment details for each agent
3. Record payment functionality
4. Commission breakdown per booking
5. Payment history

Would you like me to create this comprehensive admin page now?
