COMPREHENSIVE UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS — BomaBnB System
🔧 1. Fix the Partner Review Bug

Ensure each partner only sees reviews belonging to their own listed properties.

Update the backend query logic to filter reviews strictly by the currently logged-in partner.

Confirm that no reviews from other partners are visible.

🗑️ 2. Remove the Migration Tab

Delete the “Migration” menu item from the partner dashboard  and navigation bar.

Remove any corresponding routes or templates linked to that tab.

Verify the dashboard loads normally without any missing-menu errors.

🤝 3. Implement the Referral System
Objective

Allow middlemen/agents to earn commissions when they onboard new hosts through their unique referral links.
also need to be approved by superadmin
Key Behavior

Each referrer (agent) receives a unique referral link used to invite hosts.

When a host registers using that link, the system records who referred them.

All properties and bookings created by that referred host are automatically tied to the referrer.

Referrer Dashboard Should Include

Overview Page

Total referred hosts

Total listed properties by referred hosts

Total bookings from referred properties

Total commissions earned

My Referral Link Page

Display referral link with copy/share options (WhatsApp, Facebook, etc.).

My Referrals Page

List all hosts joined via referral with their basic stats (number of properties, total bookings).

Properties from My Referrals

Show only the properties belonging to referred hosts.

Bookings from My Referrals

Display booking list related to referred properties with details such as booking date, amount, and status.

Commissions & Payouts Page

Summarize total earnings, pending commissions, and payout history.

Include a “Request Payout” button.

Access Control

Referrers see only their referral-related data.

Partners see only their own listings and bookings.

Superadmin retains visibility of all system data.

Commission Setup

Commission defaults to 10% of every completed booking from referred partners.

The commission is automatically added to the referrer’s record when a booking is marked as completed.

Optionally include payout requests and a status tracker for transparency.

🧠 4. General Behavior Notes

Maintain clean dashboard UI separation: Partner, Referrer, Admin, and Superadmin dashboards should each have distinct sidebars and visual identities.

Ensure consistency of the responsive design across all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Test the workflow: Referral link → Partner registration → Property listing → Booking → Commission update → Referrer dashboard display.

Confirm email and/or WhatsApp notifications are triggered properly upon successful registration and booking actions.

✅ Expected Results

Partners see only their own reviews.

The Migration tab no longer appears.

Referral system is live and functional with its own dashboard, referral link, commission tracking, and restricted data views.

The system runs smoothly across all dashboards with no visual or permission bugs.
