You are analyzing an existing project named Bomabnb, a web platform that connects travelers with local BnBs.
Your task is to review and fix issues in the Superadmin Dashboard to ensure full functionality, proper backend connectivity, and professional responsiveness.

1️⃣ Partner Management

Ensure every partner record in the Partner Management table has clear, responsive action buttons:

✅ Approve — sets status to “approved”

🚫 Suspend — sets status to “suspended”

🔄 Reactivate — sets status back to “approved”

❌ Delete — removes the partner and their associated listings

Each action should:

Update the database immediately

Display a success or error alert

Refresh the table dynamically

Add a confirmation modal for sensitive actions (like Suspend/Delete).

2️⃣ Property Management (Featured System)

Verify each property record includes an is_featured (boolean) or featured_until (date) field.

Add working action buttons:

🌟 Feature / Unfeature toggle

Ensure featured properties:

Always appear at the top of homepage and listings

Are visually distinct (e.g., a gold “Featured” tag)

Can be unfeatured any time

Confirm the feature/unfeature action updates the backend instantly and gives clear visual feedback.

3️⃣ Settings Page

Ensure the Superadmin can save and update contact details:

WhatsApp (with +254 prefix)

Phone number

Email address

Verify form submission updates the backend correctly (no empty or broken endpoints).

Display a clear “Settings saved successfully ✅” toast or message upon saving.

4️⃣ Design and Responsiveness

Keep all Superadmin pages fully responsive across devices.

Maintain a consistent sidebar layout:

Sidebar remains visible or collapsible on smaller screens.

Highlight the active section.

Use professional color coordination consistent with the Bomabnb branding:

Safari Gold #D4A017

Forest Green #2E5339

Red Clay #B6461E

Off White #F9F7F3

5️⃣ General Behavior

All backend updates must sync instantly without full-page reloads.

Add proper success/error notifications.

Ensure no Supabase confirmation emails are sent on registration approvals.

Test every Superadmin action to verify correct role-based permissions and database reflection.

After all verifications and implementations:
✅ Partner status changes work perfectly
✅ Property featuring functions properly
✅ Settings save as expected
✅ UI is mobile-friendly and professional
