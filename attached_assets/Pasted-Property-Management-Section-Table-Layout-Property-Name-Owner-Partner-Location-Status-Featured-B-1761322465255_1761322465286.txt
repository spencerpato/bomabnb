Property Management Section
📋 Table Layout
Property Name	Owner (Partner)	Location	Status	Featured	Bookings	Actions

Each property shows clear ownership and quick management controls.

⚡ Action Buttons per Property

👁️ View Property → Opens property page preview (in modal or new tab).

🌟 Feature / Unfeature Property

Toggles whether a property appears in the “Featured” section of the homepage.

When Featured: button text = “Unfeature” (gold star icon filled).

When Not Featured: button text = “Feature” (outline star icon).

📝 Edit Details → Opens editable property form.

❌ Delete → Confirmation modal before permanent removal.

⚠️ 3. FIXING THE "REMOVE FEATURE" ERROR
🧩 Likely Cause

The error when unfeaturing a property often comes from:

Missing or invalid property ID or feature reference in the backend.

Trying to update a field (isFeatured, featured_until, etc.) that doesn’t exist or has null constraints.

Improper Supabase rule (Row Level Security) blocking update.

🛠️ What to Check and Fix

Ensure each property in the database has a boolean field, e.g.:

is_featured: boolean DEFAULT false


The “Unfeature” action should simply toggle this field to false, not delete any row.

The query or API endpoint for “remove feature” should do:

update properties set is_featured = false where id = property_id;


— not delete or unlink.

Ensure the property belongs to a verified partner (Superadmin should still override).

Check Supabase RLS (if enabled):

Admin role should have unrestricted access to update rows.
