Fix “Page Not Found” on Netlify Refresh

Problem: When reloading routes such as /partner-dashboard or /superadmin-dashboard, Netlify returns a “Page Not Found” error.

Action:

Add a _redirects file in the project’s /public directory.

Content of _redirects file:

/*    /index.html   200


Redeploy to Netlify and test all nested routes to ensure pages persist on reload or direct navigation.

Confirm dashboard and other client-side routes open smoothly after refresh.

💬 2️⃣ WhatsApp Automation Feature
🔹 A. Booking Confirmation → Send to Property Owner

After a user successfully submits a booking form, show a success alert like:

“Booking submitted successfully! ✅ You can also notify the host directly via WhatsApp.”

Include a “Send to WhatsApp” button below the message.

When clicked, it opens WhatsApp with a pre-customized message using the property owner’s saved WhatsApp number from their profile:

https://wa.me/<OwnerNumber>?text=Hello%20<OwnerName>,%20I%20just%20booked%20your%20property%20(<PropertyName>)%20on%20BomaBnB.%20Looking%20forward%20to%20my%20stay!


Ensure the message dynamically fetches the property name and owner name.

🔹 B. Partner Registration → Notify Superadmin

After a new partner successfully registers, show:

“Registration successful 🎉. Your account is awaiting approval from our admin team.”

Include a “Send to Admin” button that opens a WhatsApp message to the Superadmin’s official WhatsApp (e.g., +254114097160):

https://wa.me/254114097160?text=Hello%20Patrick,%20a%20new%20partner%20(%3CPartnerName%3E)%20has%20just%20registered%20on%20BomaBnB%20and%20is%20awaiting%20approval.


This helps admins stay updated even without checking the dashboard constantly.

🔹 C. Optional Auto Message Formatting

Use dynamic fields with encodeURIComponent() (if JS) to prevent URL errors.

All WhatsApp buttons should open in a new tab (target="_blank").

🧭 3️⃣ UX and Placement

Place booking WhatsApp button below the booking confirmation alert.

Place registration WhatsApp button in the success modal after registration submission.

Use WhatsApp icon (fa-whatsapp) styled in brand color (#25D366) with hover effect.

✅ Expected Outcome

Reloading any route (Partner/Admin Dashboard) no longer triggers “Page Not Found” on Netlify.

After booking → “Send to WhatsApp” button appears with prefilled message to property owner.

After registration → “Send to Admin” button opens prefilled message to Superadmin.

WhatsApp links are clickable, formatted, and personalized.

Smooth, responsive experience maintained across all devices.
