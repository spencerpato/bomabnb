Instructions to Update BomaBnB Homepage & System (Agent Feature + Fixes)

Homepage Updates

Add a third button labeled “Join as Agent” on top of the homepage carousel alongside Partner With Us and Partner Login buttons.

The Join as Agent button should be slightly smaller in size for visual balance.

Clicking the button should redirect to the same registration modal/page used by partners, but when selected, it should register the user with the role “Agent.”

Add a hover tooltip or caption: “Earn commission by referring hosts to BomaBnB.”

Login Modal

Agents should log in using the same login form used by partners.

On login, the system should detect the user role (Agent or Partner) and automatically redirect them to their respective dashboard.

Agent Dashboard

Keep a persistent sidebar (same design as partner dashboard).

Include:

Profile section: agent name, email, contact, total referred users, and total commissions earned.

Referred Properties tab: show a list of all properties added by partners who registered using the agent’s referral link (with property name, owner, location, and status).

Bookings tab: show all bookings for those referred properties, including status (pending, confirmed, declined).

Commission tab: overview of total commission earned per booking.

Notifications tab: updates on referred users and system messages.

Logout button.

Referral Registration Logic

Each agent should have a unique referral link, automatically generated upon registration.

When a partner signs up through that link, the system automatically assigns that partner’s properties and bookings to the referring agent.

Admin Dashboard Updates

In the Partner Management section, include a column showing the referring agent (if any).

Add an Agent Management section where the superadmin can:

View agent profiles and referred partners.

Edit, suspend, or delete an agent.

Manage agent commissions and payouts.

Fixes & Improvements

Fix the reviews issue: Ensure each partner only sees reviews and ratings related to their own properties.

Remove the “Migration” tab from the partner dashboard.

Ensure Netlify 404 error when reloading dashboards is fixed by properly configuring route redirects.

Maintain sidebar persistence on all dashboards and highlight the active page.

Responsiveness

All dashboards (admin, partner, and agent) and homepage must be fully mobile responsive, automatically adjusting layouts for phones and tablets.

Buttons on mobile should remain visible on the carousel (especially Partner With Us, Partner Login, and Join as Agent).
