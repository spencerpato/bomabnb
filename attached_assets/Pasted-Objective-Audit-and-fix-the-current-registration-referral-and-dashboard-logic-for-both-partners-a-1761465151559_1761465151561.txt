Objective:
Audit and fix the current registration, referral, and dashboard logic for both partners and agents on Bomabnb to ensure proper functionality, approval flow, referral tracking, and responsiveness.

🧩 Fix 1: Registration & Redirect Behavior

After partner or agent registration, the user should:

See a success alert message:
“Registration successful! Please wait for admin approval before logging in.”

Be redirected back to the homepage, but without showing any “Dashboard” button or access until approved.

Only approved users should see the “Dashboard” button after logging in.

If login attempted before approval:

Show clear alert:

Partner: “Your account is pending approval.”

Agent: “Your agent account is pending approval.”

Redirect stays on the homepage.

🧩 Fix 2: Referral Tracking & Linking

When a partner registers using an agent’s referral link, ensure:

Their record is saved in the referrals table, including:

referrer_id (agent’s ID),

referred_partner_id (partner’s ID),

date_joined

The referral appears:

On admin dashboard under “Agent Referrals” tab

On agent dashboard under “My Referrals” tab

Add a backend validation to check that the referral was captured correctly on registration.

🧩 Fix 3: Booking Visibility for Agents

Agents should be able to view bookings made on properties belonging to their referred partners only.

Include a tab called “Referred Bookings” in the agent dashboard.

The admin should also see this data under a unified “Agent Booking Reports” section.

🧩 Fix 4: Agent Referral Link Display

On the agent dashboard, the “Referral Code” should be replaced with the full referral link (e.g. https://bomabnb.netlify.app/register?ref=AGENTCODE).

Include a “Copy Link” button beside it for convenience.

The link should be generated dynamically based on the agent’s code.

🧩 Fix 5: Mobile Responsiveness

Make sure the agent dashboard (and all its tabs like “Referrals”, “Bookings”, “Profile”) are fully mobile responsive.

Cards stack neatly.

Tables scroll horizontally on small screens.

Sidebar collapses into a top menu or hamburger icon.

Fonts scale correctly for smaller devices.

🧩 Fix 6: Security & Access Control

Add strict access control for:

Agents can’t access partner or admin URLs directly.

Unapproved accounts can’t access dashboards even by typing URLs manually.

Ensure dashboards are only accessible after login and approval verification.

🧩 Fix 7: Admin Dashboard Enhancements

Add an “Agents” tab where the superadmin can:

View agent details.

See referred partners and their total bookings.

Approve, suspend, or delete an agent.

Add analytics to show:

Total referrals per agent.

Conversion rate (referrals that became active partners).

🧩 Fix 8: Alerts & Notifications

Display clear visual alerts for:

Registration success.

Approval or suspension.

Referral success.

Booking confirmation.

Ensure all these alerts fade smoothly and look professional on both desktop and mobile.

✅ Expected Result

After implementing:

Unapproved users cannot access dashboards.

Referral links are working and visible.

Agents see referred partners and their bookings.

Admins can manage agents, partners, and referrals.

The system looks clean and responsive across all screens.

Would you like me to write you a follow-up prompt (Part 2) that focuses only on referral analytics and commission payout logic for agents (so they can track their earnings)?

You said:
on the admin tables still remember that even if the partner is reffered they still have to wait approval, so is it possible that they appears on both refferal and also partners table because after approval they become partners?

Exactly right bro 💯 — that’s the best and most professional logic to follow.

Here’s how you should instruct the AI or dev system to handle it properly 👇

🧭 Instruction Prompt: Referral + Partner Synchronization Logic

Objective:
Ensure that any partner who registers through an agent’s referral link appears correctly in both the “Referrals” table and the “Partners” table, maintaining the approval workflow and visibility for all relevant dashboards.

🧩 Fix 1: Dual Table Entry Logic

When a partner registers using an agent’s referral link, automatically:

Create a record in the Referrals table with:

referrer_id (agent ID),

referred_partner_id (partner ID),

status = pending,

date_joined.

Create a record in the Partners table with:

Partner details (business name, contacts, etc.),

approval_status = pending,

referrer_id (optional link to agent for traceability).

This ensures the partner appears in both tables from the start.

🧩 Fix 2: Status Synchronization

When a superadmin approves a referred partner:

Update the partner’s status in the Partners table to approved.

Automatically update the corresponding referral record to:

status = approved

approval_date = current_date

If a partner is suspended or deleted, reflect the same in the referral record.

🧩 Fix 3: Dashboard Visibility

Admin Dashboard:

Under Partners tab: show all partners (whether referred or direct).

Under Referrals tab: show referred partners with their corresponding agents.

When viewing an agent profile, include a list of all their referred partners and their approval statuses.

Agent Dashboard:

Under My Referrals tab: show all referred partners with their status (Pending, Approved, Suspended).

When a referral is approved, the agent sees a notification or status update.

Partner Dashboard:

No referral details visible here (to keep it clean).

🧩 Fix 4: Reporting and Analytics

Allow the admin to generate reports such as:

Total partners.

Total referred partners.

Conversion rate (approved referrals ÷ total referrals).

Earnings potential for agents if commission is later implemented.

🧩 Fix 5: Access Control

Referral registration should never bypass the approval step.

The partner, even if referred, should remain inactive (no dashboard access) until approved.

✅ Expected Result

Once applied:

Referred partners will appear in both Partners and Referrals tables.

Approval changes will stay synchronized.

Admin can manage referred and direct partners seamlessly.

Agents can clearly track the status of their referred partners.
