MOBILE-FIRST DESIGN POLISH PLAN (BomaBnB)
🏠 Homepage (Public) — Mobile Version
🎯 Goal:
Make it simple, modern, and immediately clear what to do.

1️⃣ Hero / Carousel Section
The background carousel (sample BnB interiors) still plays full width with soft fade transitions.
Overlay two main CTA buttons on top of it:
🏡 Partner With Us (Primary button, Gold background #D4A017, white text)
🔑 Partner Login (Secondary, bordered button, transparent with white border)
Position:
Centered vertically within the carousel, stacked vertically.
Add a light blur behind buttons for readability.
Slight shadow for elevation.
Example layout (visually):
[Carousel image plays here]
   [ Your home away from home ]
   [ Partner With Us ] [ Partner Login ]

Bonus:
Below the carousel, display a short intro line:
“Explore verified Kenyan Airbnbs hosted by locals — comfort meets culture.”

2️⃣ Search & Filter
Move the search bar just below the carousel.
Rounded edges, full width, simple placeholder:
“Search by location, name, or price range...”
Auto-filters with every character typed (real-time).
Optionally, include a small filter icon to open advanced filters (Price, Type, Rating).

3️⃣ Listings Section
Display one listing per row (cleaner and easier to interact with).
Include a ‘Featured’ ribbon tag for paid top listings.
Add swipe gesture for image gallery preview on mobile.

4️⃣ Footer
Large, circular clickable contact icons (WhatsApp, Call, Email).
Small caption below:
“Made with ❤️ by Patrick” (❤️ is still the superadmin link).

🧑‍💼 Partner Dashboard (Mobile View)
Keep the sidebar hidden behind a hamburger icon (top-left corner).
When opened, it slides over the screen.
Sidebar shows:
Partner profile pic
Name + Business Name
Quick links:

📲 Responsive Behavior Recap
Screen SizeAdjustments
Mobile (<768px)
1 listing per row, sidebar collapses, buttons stack, notifications slide-down
Tablet (≥768px)
2 listings per row, sidebar collapsible, charts scale smaller
Desktop (≥1024px)
3–4 listings per row, persistent sidebar, full analytics and data tables

🌟 Final Touch: User Experience
All call-to-action buttons large enough for thumb tap (44px min height).
Consistent use of Safari Gold (#D4A017) for main actions.
Every page should load in <2s (cache assets smartly).
Floating notifications slide up briefly for messages like:
“Partner approved successfully ✅”
“Property deleted ❌”
“New booking received 📩”
