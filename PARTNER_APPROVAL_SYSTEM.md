# Partner Approval System

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive approval system that prevents non-approved partners from accessing their dashboard until they are approved by an admin. The system shows appropriate status messages based on whether the partner was referred by an agent or registered directly.

## Problem Statement
Previously, partners could access their dashboard immediately after registration, regardless of their approval status. This caused:
- ❌ Unapproved partners seeing empty dashboards
- ❌ No clear indication of pending approval
- ❌ No differentiation between referred and direct registrations
- ❌ Poor user experience for pending partners

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Pending Approval Page** (`PartnerPendingApproval.tsx`)
A dedicated page that displays status information while partners wait for approval.

**Features**:
- ✅ Shows current approval status (pending, rejected, suspended)
- ✅ Displays registration details
- ✅ Shows referrer information if referred by an agent
- ✅ Different messages based on status
- ✅ Auto-refreshes status every 30 seconds
- ✅ Manual refresh button
- ✅ Logout functionality

**Status Types**:
1. **Pending** - Yellow theme, waiting for admin approval
2. **Rejected** - Red theme, application not approved
3. **Suspended** - Orange theme, temporarily suspended

### 2. **Partner Authentication Utility** (`utils/partnerAuth.ts`)
Reusable function to check partner approval status.

**Function**: `checkPartnerApproval(navigate)`

**Returns**:
```typescript
{
  isApproved: boolean,
  status: string,
  partnerId: string | null
}
```

**Checks**:
1. ✅ User is authenticated
2. ✅ User has partner role
3. ✅ Partner account exists
4. ✅ Partner status is "active"
5. ✅ Redirects appropriately if any check fails

### 3. **Protected Partner Layout** (`PartnerLayout.tsx`)
Updated to check approval status before rendering.

**Protection**:
- Checks approval on mount
- Shows loading spinner during check
- Redirects if not approved
- Only renders content for approved partners

**Impact**: All partner pages using `PartnerLayout` are now automatically protected.

### 4. **Dashboard Status Check** (`PartnerDashboard.tsx`)
Added status check before loading dashboard data.

**Flow**:
```typescript
1. Authenticate user
2. Check partner role
3. Fetch partner data
4. ❗ Check if status === "active"
5. If not active → redirect to /partner-pending-approval
6. If active → load dashboard
```

## Files Created
