# üîç Troubleshooting Property Images Not Showing

## Quick Test Steps:

### Step 1: Check Storage Bucket Exists
1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí **Storage**
2. Verify you see a bucket named: `property-images`
3. Verify it shows **Public** badge (green)
4. If not public, click on it ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Make it Public

### Step 2: Test Manual Upload
1. Click on `property-images` bucket
2. Try uploading a test image manually
3. If you get an error ‚Üí Policies are missing
4. If it uploads ‚Üí Click on the image and copy the URL
5. Open that URL in a new browser tab
6. If you can see the image ‚Üí Storage is working ‚úÖ

### Step 3: Check Policies
Click on `property-images` ‚Üí **Policies** tab

You should see **2 policies**:
- ‚úÖ One for **INSERT** (upload)
- ‚úÖ One for **SELECT** (view)

If missing, add them:

**Policy 1 - Upload:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload property images"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'property-images');
```

**Policy 2 - View:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Public can view property images"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'property-images');
```

### Step 4: Watch Browser Console
1. Open your site
2. Press **F12** (Developer Tools)
3. Go to **Console** tab
4. Try adding a property
5. Look for messages:
   - ‚úÖ "Uploading image to: properties/..."
   - ‚úÖ "Image uploaded successfully: [URL]"
   - ‚ùå "Upload error: ..." ‚Üê If you see this, read the error

### Step 5: Check What's in Database
Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
SELECT property_name, featured_image 
FROM properties 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

Check the `featured_image` column:
- ‚úÖ Should be a URL like: `https://[project].supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/property-images/...`
- ‚ùå If it's the Unsplash URL ‚Üí Upload failed, using fallback

### Step 6: Test Image URL
1. Copy the `featured_image` URL from database
2. Open it in a new browser tab
3. ‚úÖ If image loads ‚Üí Storage is working, issue is elsewhere
4. ‚ùå If 404 or error ‚Üí Storage policies are wrong

## Common Issues & Fixes:

### Issue 1: "Bucket not found"
**Fix:** Create the bucket:
- Name: `property-images` (lowercase, with dash)
- Public: ‚úÖ Must check this box

### Issue 2: "New row violates policy"
**Fix:** Add the upload policy (Policy 1 above)

### Issue 3: Images show placeholder
**Cause:** Upload is failing silently
**Fix:** Check browser console for error message

### Issue 4: "Access denied" when viewing image
**Fix:** Add the view policy (Policy 2 above)

### Issue 5: CORS errors
**Fix:** Make sure bucket is truly **Public**

---

## What You Should See When It Works:

1. **During upload:**
   - Toast: "Image uploaded successfully!"
   - Console: Full URL logged

2. **In database:**
   - `featured_image` = `https://[your-project].supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/property-images/properties/[timestamp]-[random].jpg`

3. **On homepage:**
   - Real uploaded image appears
   - NOT the Unsplash placeholder

## Still Not Working?

### Check This:
1. Is bucket really public? (has green Public badge)
2. Are BOTH policies added? (INSERT + SELECT)
3. Does manual upload work in the dashboard?
4. What error shows in browser console?

### Quick Fix - Use Simple Policy:
If nothing works, try this simpler approach in SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Delete existing policies
DELETE FROM storage.policies WHERE bucket_id = 'property-images';

-- Add simple public access
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can do anything with property images"
ON storage.objects FOR ALL
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'property-images')
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'property-images');
```

This gives full public access (not ideal for production, but good for testing).

**Try adding a property again after these checks and watch the console!** üîç
