# URGENT: Apply This SQL to Fix Agent Registration

## The Problem
- **Agent registration is failing** with error: "new row violates row-level security policy for table 'user_roles'"
- **Admin dashboard not showing agent data** because of restrictive RLS policies

## The Solution
You need to apply the SQL migration in `supabase/migrations/20251026_fix_rls_policies.sql` to your Supabase database.

## How to Apply (Choose ONE method):

### Method 1: Supabase Dashboard (Easiest - 2 minutes)
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: `dgffjmbbzamwydpwxwkm`
3. Click **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar
4. Click **"New Query"**
5. **Copy ALL the SQL** from `supabase/migrations/20251026_fix_rls_policies.sql`
6. **Paste it** into the SQL editor
7. Click **"Run"** (or press Ctrl+Enter)
8. âœ… Done! Test agent registration

### Method 2: Supabase CLI (If you have it installed)
```bash
# Link to your project
supabase link --project-ref dgffjmbbzamwydpwxwkm

# Apply the migration
supabase db push
```

### Method 3: Quick Fix - Run This SQL Directly
If you just want the essential fixes, run this shorter version:

```sql
-- Fix user_roles table to allow agent registration
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own role during registration" ON user_roles;
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own role during registration"
ON user_roles FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Fix profiles table for admin access
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all profiles" ON profiles;
CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all profiles"
ON profiles FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM user_roles
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
  )
);

-- Fix referrers table for admin access
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all referrers" ON referrers;
CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all referrers"
ON referrers FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM user_roles
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
  )
);

-- Fix referrals table for admin access
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all referrals" ON referrals;
CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all referrals"
ON referrals FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM user_roles
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
  )
);

-- Fix commissions table for admin access
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all commissions" ON commissions;
CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all commissions"
ON commissions FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM user_roles
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
  )
);
```

## What This SQL Does:
1. âœ… Allows users to register as agents (fixes the RLS error)
2. âœ… Allows admins to view all agent data
3. âœ… Allows agents to view their own data
4. âœ… Secures the database with proper row-level security

## After Applying:
1. Try registering a new agent - it should work!
2. Log in as admin - you should see all agent details
3. Everything should work smoothly ðŸŽ‰
